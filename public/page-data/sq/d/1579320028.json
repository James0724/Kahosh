I believe that portfolio is important for any dev since it connects you to future opportunities and it helps you to grow your network.\n\nThe rewarding field of web development comes with many perks, but itâ€™s one of those jobs that require habitual learning and self-improvement. I therefore believe there's still some stuff I have to improve on, like testing browser compatibility, tweaking some UX, etc, so it's still a work in progress, for sure. But hey, everyone has to start somewhere, right?\n\nNow let me talk a little bit of my portfolio and myself in general. As you can see for your self my portfolio is a bit simple and staright forward, since I am a self taught software engineer I will constantly post my learning progress on my portfolio with links to some of the exciting projects I will be working on. You can also contact me through my portfolio page in the contact section and I will be glad to reply you on whatever issue you may want us to talk on whether a gig or just an enquiry. I will  be pleased to help.\n\nAbout myself, I can say no mountain is too big for me to climb, I just get the necessary gears I need and off I begin my climb. The journey may be rough, discouraging, tough or even slow but one important thing I know I must touch the peak.\n\nwith that I hope for the best and a successful caree on software development as I help you reach your goals in software development needs.
